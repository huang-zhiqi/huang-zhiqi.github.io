I am a Master's (M.Phil) student in Information Architecture at **Waseda University** (早稲田大学). My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Graphics** and **Computer Vision**, with a specific focus on **3D Generation**.

Previously, I worked as a **Senior Graphics Engineer** at **4399 Games** for three years, where I contributed to the rendering pipeline of the globally released title *"Era of Conquest"*. I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from **Sun Yat-sen University** (中山大学) in 2021.

🔥 **News**
*   **[Jan 2026]** One paper titled **"SIE3D"** (First Author) is accepted to **ICASSP 2026**!
*   **[Seeking]** I am currently seeking **Research Assistant (RA)** positions (Remote or Onsite) for immediate start.
*   **[Seeking]** I am also looking for **Ph.D. opportunities** for the 2027 intake (Spring or Fall).

## 📝 Publications

* **SIE3D: Single-Image Expressive 3D Avatar Generation via Semantic Embedding and Perceptual Expression Loss**
  * *IEEE ICASSP 2026 (Accepted)* — **First Author, Corresponding Author** 
  * Authors: **Zhiqi Huang**, Dulongkai Cui, Jinglu Hu
  
> **Highlight:** We propose **SIE3D**, a framework for generating text-controllable 3D avatars from a single image. By introducing a novel **semantic embedding fusion** and a **perceptual expression loss**, we achieve state-of-the-art expression fidelity and identity preservation on consumer-grade GPUs.
